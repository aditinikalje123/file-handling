It's commonly used for cleanup tasks like closing files, releasing resources, or ensuring database connections are closed.\n","\n","4)Logging in Python refers to the practice of recording events that occur during the execution of a program. It involves tracking information about the program's behavior, such as errors, warnings, and other relevant details.\n","\n","5)What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n","Ans:-The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. This happens when an object's reference count drops to zero, typically due to garbage collection.\n","\n","6) What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n","Ans:-n Python, both import and from ... import are used to bring modules or specific objects from modules into your current script.\n","\n","7)How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n","AnS:-To catch multiple exceptions in Python in a compact form, you can use the one-line try-except syntax\n","\n","8)What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n","Ans:-The with statement in Python simplifies file handling by ensuring that files are properly closed after their use, even if exceptions occur. This is achieved through the concept of \"context managers.\n","\n","9)F What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n","Ans:-Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process, while multiprocessing runs multiple processes independently, each with its own resources\n","\n","10)What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n","Ans:-Logging provides significant advantages in program development and management, enhancing debugging, performance monitoring, security auditing, and compliance\n","\n","11)What is memory management in Python\n","Ans:-Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n","\n","12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n","Ans:-exceptions are caught and handled using the 'try' and 'except' block. 'try' contains the code segment which is susceptible to error, while 'except' is where the program should jump in case an exception occurs. You can use multiple 'except' blocks for handling different types of exceptions\n","\n","13)Why is memory management important in Python\n","Ans:-Without proper memory management, you can face challenges while building these applications, as effective memory allocation is necessary in order to avoid problems that can arise when you run out of memory, such as memory leaks.\n","\n","\n","14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n","Ans:-In exception handling, try and except blocks work together to gracefully manage errors. The try block contains code that might potentially raise an exception, while the except block catches and handles these exceptions, preventing the program from crashing.\n","\n","\n","15)How does Python's garbage collection system work\n","Ans:-Python uses a hybrid garbage collection system combining reference counting and generational garbage collection to manage memory effectively.\n","\n","16)What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n","Ans:-The 'else' block is useful when you want to perform specific actions when no exceptions occur\n","\n","17)What are the common logging levels in Python\n","Ans:-Python's logging module offers a range of logging levels to categorize messages based on their severity, aiding in debugging and monitoring applications.\n","\n","18)What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n","Ans:-os.fork() is a system call that directly creates a copy of the current process. This includes the memory space, open file descriptors, and other resources.The multiprocessing module is a higher-level abstraction that provides a more portable and safer way to create and manage processes.\n","\n","19)What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n","Ans:-Closing files in Python is an essential practice that helps maintain data integrity, prevent resource leaks, and ensure the reliability of your applications\n","\n","20)What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n","Ans:-the `read()` method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream\n","\n","21)What is the logging module in Python used for\n","Ans:-built-in logging module to capture logs, which provide insights into application flow, errors, and usage patterns.\n","\n","22)Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n","\n","23)What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n","Ans:-the primary memory management challenges include automatic garbage collection potentially introducing latency, cyclic references causing memory leaks, and the dynamic typing of Python leading to higher memory consumption than statically-typed languages.\n","\n","24) How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n","Ans:-use the raise keyword\n","\n","25) Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","Ans:-Multithreading is essential for applications because it allows for concurrent execution of tasks, improving performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization"],"metadata":{"id":"7Q30tu3ttjxP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n","1) How can you open a file for writing
